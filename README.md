# Deep Learning Text Classification Project
## Project Overview

This project investigates the application of binary sentiment analysis on Amazon review texts using various neural network architectures. We have implemented four models:
1. **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)**
2. **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) integrated with LSTM capabilities**
3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
4. **Transformer-based Distil BERT model**
The dataset comprises 3.6 million Amazon reviews, providing a substantial base for analyzing and classifying sentiments as positive or negative.
Our primary aim is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models in classifying review sentiments. We employ performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to gauge their efficacy. Preliminary results indicate competitive performance across all models, with the Distil BERT model demonstrating the highest accuracy of 96.30%, showcasing its superior capability in handling sentiment analysis tasks.

Additionally, a project report detailing our methodologies, results, and analysis has been included in the repository. While the code for CNN and Distil BERT is currently not available, we plan to polish and add this code to the repository shortly. Future work will focus on addressing limitations observed in misclassification cases, particularly in detecting sarcasm and handling mixed sentiments.
